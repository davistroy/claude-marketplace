# Document Assessment Command

Perform a comprehensive evaluation of the specified document, identifying gaps, issues, missing content, and areas for improvement. Produce a detailed assessment report.

## Input Validation

**Required Arguments:**
- `<document-path>` - Path to the document to assess

**Optional Arguments:**
- `--format [md|json]` - Output format (default: md)
  - `md`: Markdown report with tables and sections (default)
  - `json`: Structured data with scores, issues array, and recommendations

**Validation:**
If the document path is missing, display:
```
Usage: /assess-document <document-path> [--format md|json]
Example: /assess-document PRD.md
Example: /assess-document PRD.md --format json
```

## Input

The user will provide a document path or name after the `/assess-document` command (e.g., `/assess-document PRD.md`).

## Instructions

### 1. Read and Analyze the Document

Thoroughly read the specified document from start to finish. Build a mental model of:
- The document's purpose and intended audience
- Its structure and organization
- The key concepts, requirements, or information it conveys
- How sections relate to each other

### 2. Evaluate Against Quality Dimensions

Assess the document across these dimensions:

#### Completeness
- Are all necessary sections present?
- Are there gaps in coverage?
- Are dependencies and prerequisites identified?
- Are edge cases and exceptions addressed?
- Is there missing context that readers would need?

#### Clarity
- Is the language clear and unambiguous?
- Are technical terms defined?
- Are complex concepts explained adequately?
- Is the intended audience clear?
- Are examples provided where helpful?

#### Consistency
- Is terminology used consistently throughout?
- Do sections contradict each other?
- Is the level of detail consistent across sections?
- Is the formatting and structure consistent?

#### Specificity
- Are requirements specific enough to be actionable?
- Are vague terms like "should", "may", "appropriate" clarified?
- Are quantities, thresholds, and constraints defined?
- Are success criteria measurable?

#### Structure & Organization
- Is the document logically organized?
- Is information easy to find?
- Are related topics grouped together?
- Is there unnecessary duplication?
- Is the hierarchy of information clear?

#### Feasibility & Realism
- Are the stated goals achievable?
- Are there unstated assumptions?
- Are resource requirements realistic?
- Are timelines (if any) reasonable?
- Are there technical or practical constraints not addressed?

### 3. Identify Specific Issues

For each issue found, capture:
- **Category**: Which quality dimension it falls under
- **Severity**: CRITICAL / WARNING / SUGGESTION (see common-patterns.md)
- **Location**: Section or line reference
- **Description**: What the issue is
- **Impact**: Why it matters
- **Recommendation**: How to address it

#### Severity Definitions

| Severity | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| **CRITICAL** | Blocks understanding or implementation; must be resolved immediately |
| **WARNING** | Significant gap or ambiguity; should be resolved before proceeding |
| **SUGGESTION** | Minor improvement opportunity; nice to have |

### 4. Produce the Assessment Report

Create a markdown file with the following structure:

```markdown
# Document Assessment: [Document Name]

**Assessment Date:** [Date]
**Document Version/Date:** [If available]
**Assessor:** Claude (Automated Review)

## Assessment Guidelines

### Be Thorough But Fair
- Look for genuine issues, not nitpicks
- Acknowledge what the document does well
- Consider the document's stated scope and purpose
- Don't penalize for intentional omissions that are noted

### Be Specific and Actionable
- Point to exact locations of issues
- Provide concrete recommendations, not vague suggestions
- Include examples of how to improve where helpful

### Maintain Objectivity
- Assess against the document's own goals
- Don't impose external standards unless relevant
- Note assumptions you're making in the assessment

### Consider Context
- A draft has different expectations than a final document
- An internal doc differs from a public-facing one
- Technical docs differ from business docs

## Example Usage

### Markdown Format (default)

```
User: /assess-document PRD.md

**Overall Score: 3.8/5**

**Issue Summary:**
- CRITICAL: 2
- WARNING: 5
- SUGGESTION: 4

**Top 3 Critical Findings:**
1. Board roles are referenced but never defined (blocks implementation)
2. No LLM provider strategy specified (blocks technical architecture)
3. Privacy policy wording not provided (blocks compliance review)
