## [5.0.0] - 2026-03-04

### Breaking Changes
- Deprecated `/convert-hooks` — use Claude ad-hoc for bash-to-PowerShell conversion
- Deprecated `/setup-statusline` — use built-in statusline-setup agent
- Deprecated `/check-updates` — use `/validate-plugin --check-updates`

### Added
- `/validate-plugin --check-updates` — version drift detection (folded from check-updates)
- `/review-pr` MCP GitHub integration — line-level review comments
- `--json` output flag on `/consolidate-documents`, `/clean-repo`, `/review-arch`
- `--focus` dimension filter on `/assess-document`, `/review-arch`

- Shared plan template at `references/plan-template.md`
- Environment variable overrides for model names and Bitwarden project ID

### Fixed
- `/test-project` missing Read/Write/Edit/Glob/Grep in allowed-tools (command was non-functional)
- `summarize-feedback` skill missing Bash for Python execution
- `security-analysis` skill missing Write for report generation
- `prime` skill contradictory allowed-tools (had Write, claimed read-only)
- `ship` skill missing Read/Edit for auto-fix loop
- Schema inconsistency: `generated_at` vs `generated_date` standardized
- Severity label mismatch in `/review-pr` standardized to 5-level scale

### Changed
- Extracted reference tables from `research-topic`, `bpmn-generator`, `validate-plugin` to reduce prompt length
- Tightened `new-command` and `new-skill` allowed-tools (removed unnecessary Bash)
- Added `Bash(git:*)` to `review-intent` and `create-plan` for git history access
