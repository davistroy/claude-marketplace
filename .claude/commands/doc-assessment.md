# Document Assessment Command

Perform a comprehensive evaluation of the specified document, identifying gaps, issues, missing content, and areas for improvement. Produce a detailed assessment report.

## Input

The user will provide a document path or name after the `/doc-assessment` command (e.g., `/doc-assessment PRD.md`).

## Instructions

### 1. Read and Analyze the Document

Thoroughly read the specified document from start to finish. Build a mental model of:
- The document's purpose and intended audience
- Its structure and organization
- The key concepts, requirements, or information it conveys
- How sections relate to each other

### 2. Evaluate Against Quality Dimensions

Assess the document across these dimensions:

#### Completeness
- Are all necessary sections present?
- Are there gaps in coverage?
- Are dependencies and prerequisites identified?
- Are edge cases and exceptions addressed?
- Is there missing context that readers would need?

#### Clarity
- Is the language clear and unambiguous?
- Are technical terms defined?
- Are complex concepts explained adequately?
- Is the intended audience clear?
- Are examples provided where helpful?

#### Consistency
- Is terminology used consistently throughout?
- Do sections contradict each other?
- Is the level of detail consistent across sections?
- Is the formatting and structure consistent?

#### Specificity
- Are requirements specific enough to be actionable?
- Are vague terms like "should", "may", "appropriate" clarified?
- Are quantities, thresholds, and constraints defined?
- Are success criteria measurable?

#### Structure & Organization
- Is the document logically organized?
- Is information easy to find?
- Are related topics grouped together?
- Is there unnecessary duplication?
- Is the hierarchy of information clear?

#### Feasibility & Realism
- Are the stated goals achievable?
- Are there unstated assumptions?
- Are resource requirements realistic?
- Are timelines (if any) reasonable?
- Are there technical or practical constraints not addressed?

### 3. Identify Specific Issues

For each issue found, capture:
- **Category**: Which quality dimension it falls under
- **Severity**: Critical / High / Medium / Low
- **Location**: Section or line reference
- **Description**: What the issue is
- **Impact**: Why it matters
- **Recommendation**: How to address it

#### Severity Definitions

| Severity | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| **Critical** | Blocks understanding or implementation; must be resolved immediately |
| **High** | Significant gap or ambiguity; must be resolved before proceeding |
| **Medium** | Notable issue that causes confusion; should be resolved |
| **Low** | Minor improvement opportunity; nice to have |

### 4. Produce the Assessment Report

Create a markdown file with the following structure:

```markdown
# Document Assessment: [Document Name]

**Assessment Date:** [Date]
**Document Version/Date:** [If available]
**Assessor:** Claude (Automated Review)

### 5. Save the Output

Save the assessment to a file named: `[document-name]-assessment-[timestamp].md`

- Place in the same directory as the source document
- Use timestamp format: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`
- Example: `PRD-assessment-20260110-143052.md`

### 6. Report Results to User

After creating the file, provide a summary including:
- Overall assessment score
- Count of issues by severity
- Top 3 most critical findings
- File path where the assessment was saved

## Assessment Guidelines

### Be Thorough But Fair
- Look for genuine issues, not nitpicks
- Acknowledge what the document does well
- Consider the document's stated scope and purpose
- Don't penalize for intentional omissions that are noted

### Be Specific and Actionable
- Point to exact locations of issues
- Provide concrete recommendations, not vague suggestions
- Include examples of how to improve where helpful

### Maintain Objectivity
- Assess against the document's own goals
- Don't impose external standards unless relevant
- Note assumptions you're making in the assessment

### Consider Context
- A draft has different expectations than a final document
- An internal doc differs from a public-facing one
- Technical docs differ from business docs

## Example Usage

```
User: /doc-assessment PRD.md

Claude: [Reads PRD.md, performs assessment, creates PRD-assessment-20260110-143052.md]

I've completed the assessment of PRD.md.

**Overall Score: 3.8/5**

**Issue Summary:**
- Critical: 2
- High: 5
- Medium: 8
- Low: 4

**Top 3 Critical Findings:**
1. Board roles are referenced but never defined (blocks implementation)
2. No LLM provider strategy specified (blocks technical architecture)
3. Privacy policy wording not provided (blocks compliance review)
